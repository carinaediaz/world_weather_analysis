# World Weather Analysis
## Overview
##### We were tasked with helping create an app that would allow consumers specify their ideal temperature conditions for a vacation to then recommend hotels and cities to visit based on the results of their unique search. We utilized Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Gmaps, and APIs to create our beta app, PlanMyTrip.
